## General info
New things I learned:

1)How to create CSS varaiables. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp)

2)How `:root {}` can be used to create global CSS variables. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root)

3)I learned that element.dataset will retun me a NodeList Object that I can manipulate to grab certain attributes set by `data-*`. In this project I was able to grab `data-sizing` from the HTML. `const suffix = this.dataset.sizing || '';`
